Shop Customer Data is a detailed analysis of a imaginative shop's ideal customers. It helps a business to better understand its customers. The owner of a shop gets information about Customers through membership cards.

Dataset consists of 2000 records and 8 columns:

Customer ID

Gender

Age

Annual Income

Spending Score - Score assigned by the shop, based on customer behavior and spending nature

Profession

Work Experience - in years

Family Size

I conducted an exploratory analysis of the dataset by calculating relevant statistical measures, creating plots, and drawing applicable conclusions using both numerical and categorical variables. The analysis was performed in two steps: univariate analysis and multivariate analysis.

Conclusions from the analysis are as follows : 

The business should target artists as their primary customers since they make up the majority and tend to spend relatively more.

They should focus on creating products tailored to high-income professionals, such as doctors, executives, and healthcare workers, to enhance business growth.

They should develop more premium products specifically for their top female customers.

Since males have a higher median overall spending, the business should focus on increasing the number of male customers to boost the percentage of male clientele.
